                <p>Event delegation is a technique for handling events where you assign a single event listener to a parent element instead of multiple event listeners to individual child elements. This can improve performance and simplify event handling.</p>

                <p>Promises are objects representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation. They allow you to write asynchronous code in a more synchronous-like manner, making it easier to manage complex asynchronous workflows.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="answer ">
                <p>Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variables and function declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope during the compilation phase. However, only the declarations are hoisted, not the initializations.</p>

                <p>'let' and 'const' are block-scoped, while 'var' is function-scoped.
                    Variables declared with 'const' cannot be re-assigned, while variables declared with 'let' and 'var' can be.
                    Variables declared with 'const' must be initialized during declaration, while variables declared with 'let' and 'var' can be initialized later.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="answer ">
                <p>A callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is executed after some operation has been completed. Callbacks are commonly used in asynchronous programming to handle asynchronous operations.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="answer ">
                <p>Synchronous programming is blocking, meaning that each operation must wait for the previous operation to complete before executing. Asynchronous programming, on the other hand, allows multiple operations to be executed concurrently, without waiting for each other to complete.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="answer ">
                <p>Errors in JavaScript can be handled using 'try...catch' blocks, which allow you to catch and handle exceptions that occur within a block of code. Additionally, you can use the throw statement to manually throw an exception.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="answer ">
                <p>The event loop is a single-threaded mechanism in JavaScript that handles asynchronous operations by continuously checking the call stack and the callback queue. It picks tasks from the callback queue and pushes them onto the call stack when the call stack is empty.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="answer ">
                <p>The 'this' keyword refers to the object that is currently executing the function. Its value is determined by how a function is called, rather than where it is defined.</p>

                <p>A prototype is an object from which other objects inherit properties and methods. Every object in JavaScript has a prototype, either directly or indirectly through the prototype chain</p>

            </div>
            <div class="answer ">
                <p>Classical inheritance involves creating hierarchical class structures and using inheritance to share behavior between classes. Prototypal inheritance, on the other hand, involves creating objects directly from other objects, without the use of classes.</p>

            <div class="answer ">
                <p>Arrow functions are a shorthand syntax for writing function expressions. They have a more concise syntax compared to traditional function expressions and inherit the 'this' value from the surrounding lexical scope.</p>

                <p>Destructuring assignment is a feature in JavaScript that allows you to extract values from arrays or objects and assign them to variables in a single statement using syntax that mirrors the structure of the array or object.</p>

                <p>A generator function in JavaScript is a special type of function that allows you to pause and resume its execution. It's defined using the function* syntax and contains one or more yield expressions. When invoked, a generator function returns an iterator object called a generator, which can be used to control the execution of the function. <br>Here's an example of a generator function: <br><br><br>  function* generateSequence() {
                    yield 1; <br>
                    yield 2; <br>
                    yield 3; <br>
                  } <br>
                  
                  const generator = generateSequence(); <br>
                  
                  console.log(generator.next()); // { value: 1, done: false } <br>
                  console.log(generator.next()); // { value: 2, done: false } <br>
                  console.log(generator.next()); // { value: 3, done: false } <br>
                  console.log(generator.next()); // { value: undefined, done: true } <br><br><br>
                  
                  In this example, 'generateSequence()' is a generator function that yields three values. When 'generator.next()' is called, the function execution is paused at the 'yield' statement, and the value is returned along with a 'done' property indicating whether the generator has finished executing. <br>  Generator functions are useful for creating iterators with custom behavior, asynchronous programming, and implementing lazy evaluation, among other things. They provide a powerful way to work with sequences and handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript.
